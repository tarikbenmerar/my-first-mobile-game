## My First Mobile Video Game JavaSokoban from 2007-2008

Before the existance of Android as a portable platform for mobile development, there were Java Micro Edition. This game was my discovery of mobile development and OOP programming.

The game is a port of  [my second ever game](https://github.com/tarikbenmerar/my-second-game) to Java Micro Edition.

## The story behind the game

I don't remember well how the idea of the game and the platform arose, but I do remember I wanted to practice OOP through this game as well as experimenting mobile development as it was in its beginning (before iPhone and android phones as programming platforms).  I tested the game on my brother Sony K750 at that time.
